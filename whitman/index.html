                                    One of the most influential writers in American literature, Walt Whitman (1819-1892) will be celebrated during his 200th birthday year around the nation and around the world. The University of Iowa Main Library’s exhibit “Walt Whitman: A Bicentennial Celebration” highlights Whitman’s writings across all stages of his life and showcases the significant scholarship on the poet that has been produced at the University of Iowa. 
                                    
                                    The exhibit features works by and about Whitman from the University of Iowa Libraries Special Collections, making these materials available for public viewing (in many cases, for the first time). Many items on display represent significant eras in Whitman’s life and writing career from his days as an upstart journalist and popular fiction writer to his moving accounts of his volunteer work in the Civil War hospitals in Washington, D.C.,  and from his radical poetic experiments in publishing his collection of poems entitled Leaves of Grass to his efforts to preserve his legacy as America’s Poet in his last years. The exhibit also reveals Whitman’s skills as a bookmaker and his enthusiasm for and involvement in the printing and physical construction of the book; it traces his lifetime of work rearranging his poetry and redesigning each edition of Leaves of Grass. It presents some of his most beloved and familiar poems, including “Song of Myself” and “Calamus,” as well as less familiar works, such as his first short story, “Death in the School-Room,” and his bestselling 1842 temperance novel Franklin Evans. The exhibit also demonstrates Whitman's incredible afterlife, during which his writings have been translated and published worldwide and preserved in both physical and digital forms. At the same time, the exhibit explores the long history of how the University of Iowa became known as the heart of Whitman Studies, and it celebrates Iowa’s significant role in the print and digital publication of Whitman scholarship. At a political and historical moment when American values and the very question of what constitutes this nation are being questioned, the exhibit will facilitate discussion about Whitman as an American poet in the nineteenth century, about how we have read him and his writings over the past two hundred years, and the place of Whitman and his writing in the years to come.

                                <p>Over the past thirty-five years, the University of Iowa has become recognized internationally as a major center for the study of Whitman.
                                        Iowa is home to the Iowa Whitman Series, published by the University of Iowa Press (UI Press)—a series of the best scholarly books on Whitman, with twenty-five titles published so far. In the 1980s, the Walt Whitman Quarterly Review (WWQR), the international journal of record for Whitman Studies, came to the university; the journal is in its thirty-sixth year, and it is now published as an open-access online journal that is freely available internationally to scholars, students, teachers, and general readers. Two previously unknown works by Whitman--his journalistic series "Manly Health and Training" (1858) and his novel Jack Engle: An Auto-Biography (1852) were reprinted in WWQR in 2016 and 2017, respectively. From its inception in the 1990s, the UI has supported and collaborated to expand the online Walt Whitman Archive, which includes Whitman's published works, as well as manuscripts, correspondence, contemporary reviews, and numerous photographs. The university and the Digital Scholarship and Publishing Studio in the UI Libraries have also facilitated digital humanities research that sheds new light on Whitman’s life and writings and asks us all to reassess what we thought we knew about America’s Poet. This exciting work has become and promises to remain vital to the future of Whitman Studies.</p>

Blalock's "Whitman's fiction," which tracks the reprinting of Whitman's short stories in newspapers and magazines during and after his lifetime. These projects present original research and represent significant collabrations between undergraduate and graduate students, the Walt Whitman Archive, and faculty and staff in the Digital Scholarship and Publishing Studio.</p>
