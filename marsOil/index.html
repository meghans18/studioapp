            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>Visit <strong>https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/mars-deepwater-gulf/</strong> to see the full project</p>
            <p><strong>This project:</strong> is devoted to documenting and narrating the story of Shell’s development of the Mars field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (3,000 feet of water), as well as associated fields the greater Mars-Ursa basin, historically the largest single source of crude oil in the Gulf. The narratives, photos, videos, and other resources gathered here offer insight into the decisions and dramas that made the Mars-Ursa megaproject a major component of domestic U.S. petroleum supply. This project also provides a forum for “Martians” and other participants — from rig-hands and laborers, to engineers and geoscientists, to managers and executives — to contribute recollections, images, or artifacts, which will help to preserve the living history and memory of Shell’s Deepwater Mission to Mars. Hundreds of thousands of people have worked directly in the Gulf of Mexico offshore oil industry over time, tens of thousands for Shell, and thousands on Mars and Ursa. This website is an attempt to preserve and tell their stories.</p>
